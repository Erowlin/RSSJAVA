RSS Feed Agregator
---

This is a fifth year project from Epitech. The goal is to build a server, a web client, a desktop client and a mobile app for a RSS Service.
The constraints are to use Java or .NET and to deploy on AWS or Azure.

#API

We decided to take advantage of the portability of Java and the technological advance of Java 8 to build our API with Java.

For the framework, we choosed to use Play2 since it's a pretty good framework to handle loads of requests and to iterate quickly.
