This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

#Launching

You basically have to have the `sbt` package and scala installed and then run the activator executable present on the repo to launch the prompt.
(The authentification is OFF because they ask for a special domain name.)
So you just have to type `run` on the activator prompt and access to localhost with the given port.
